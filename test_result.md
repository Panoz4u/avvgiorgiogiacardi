- Component: Animation V4 (Pixels & Parallax)
- Status: **PASSED**
- Notes:
    - **"Why Us"**: Implemented "Big Pixel Grid" animation. The grid scales up and fades in, creating a transition from Navy to Electric Blue.
    - **Cards Stack**: The 3 cards (01, 02, 03) now parallax stack on top of each other after the pixel transition.
    - **Contact**: Fixed mobile font size using fluid `text-[13vw]` and translated all form labels.
    - **Footer**: Reverted to huge Marquee background as requested ("Avvocato Giorgio Giacardi" scrolling slowly). Links stay on top.
    - **Hero**: Fixed ticker overlap by ensuring flex container and proper spacing/duplication.
